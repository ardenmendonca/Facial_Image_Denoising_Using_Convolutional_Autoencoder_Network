# Facial-Image-Denoising-Using-Convolutional-Autoencoder-Network

Conversion of the research paper [1] into code.

Abstract â€” Noise effects can interfere the face recognition
process in outdoor conditions. Therefore, image denoising topic is
the classical issue in the field of image processing and computer
vision subjects. In this paper, we show that the solution of
denoising process using the autoencoder networks based on the
ORL face database. The proposed method can support face
recognition systems designed for use in an outdoor environment
as the preprocessing stage and it can provide the effective results
after training process
